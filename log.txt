Select C# Console App when creating project.

Right click project -> Edit project file. This changes the .csproj file.

Change <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"> to <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">. This automatically includes everything from the Microsoft.AspNetCore.App framework.

Change access specifier of Program class and Main method to public. (App will still run for some reason even if this step is not done)

Replace Main's content with following code.
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();
app.MapGet("/", () => "Response message");
app.Run();
